# Reisekompis for the web

This project is a web version of [Reisekompis - an Android application](https://github.com/estien/ReisekompisAndroid).

Feel free to contribute.

## Set up information for developers

So you want to help out? That's cool! I've made it pretty easy for you to get started.

Prerequisites are node and npm. You can set those up pretty easily by using 
[these install scripts](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814)!

Once you've cloned the project, simply run ``npm install``. This will install all 
dependencies for you. Once this is done, type in ``grunt`` to build the project.

Set up a server to develop on using ``grunt serve``. 

### Note!
The application is currently set up to work with a local version of the Reisekompis service application. You can clone your own version of this nifty little abstraction layer at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/estien/ReisekompisService).

## About this project.

This is a personal project of mine, set up with [Yeomin](http://www.yeomin.io). It is not yet online, but will hopefully be soon. Feel free to contribute with pull requests, and if you want me to add you as a contributor - get in touch.
